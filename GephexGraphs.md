# Introduction #

There needs to be more example videos along with downloadable graphs, so I'll take some of mine and allow them to be used by anyone under the terms of the GPL.

This effect is built up from this source image:

**Harrier**

This effect creates a gradually changing terrain tile, which it zooms at the viewer, creating the impression of flying over a landscape.  A fractal object floats over the landscape, banking and turning while it transforms.

**Sidescroller**

Similar vein as Harrier

The basics of this graph is two mixers and a plasma block, but it needs a lot of tuning to look cool.  The source input is pretty important, the ising noise block isn't the best but I think I made it work.

Feedback can be pretty compelling, but typically leads to periodicity- signal generators set to noize can avoid too much repetition but any effect looks samey after a while.
